# About
This is the class D amplifier for the speaker box.
It should be a board, which contains two class D
circuits, one for high and the other for low/middle tone.

It may be best to look for other open source
designs and use them.


# Technical

Class D amp IC: [TI TPA3245](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tpa3245.pdf)

Poer Supply: [Mean Well EPP-300-27](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/260/r1835_3-1109476.pdf)  
We also need 12V here, should take this from the other supply
of control board maybe.

# Tools
The PCBs should be designed with KiCAD.
